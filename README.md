# SJTU Small Traffic Light Dataset (S<sup>2</sup>TLD)     

## Data Description
S<sup>2</sup>TLD is our newly released traffic light dataset, which contains 5,786 images of approximately 1,080 * 1,920 pixels and 720 * 1,280 pixels. It also contains 5 categories (include red, yellow, green, off and wait on) of 1,4130 instances. 
The scenes cover a decent variety of road scenes and typical:
* Busy street scenes inner-city, 
* Dense stop-and-go traffic
* Strong changes in illumination/exposure
* Flickering/Fluctuating traffic lights
* Multiple visible traffic lights
* Image parts that can be confused with traffic lights (e.g. large round tail lights)
